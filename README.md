The WinnersOnlineHospital is meant to connect patients to doctors or health care stations without necessarily reaching the hospital in person.
Health is the backbone of every nation and so every country has to invest dearly in the health sector to see it's citizens in good life.
To access these online hospital services, you need to create an account by registering then login to your account.

In this project, I used the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* PHP
* MySQL

To use the online hospital, you'll land on the home window which consist of various pages that will help you navigate to other parts of the system. But accessing our services will require a patient to creat an account by clicking on the patient iccon on the top nav in the home page, chose sign up then register. After successfull registration, the form will take you to a login page which after filling correctly, will lead you to the dashboard where you can fully access our services. However, even if you haven't created an account with us,you can still communicate to the WinnersOnlineHospital by using the addresses or contacts on our contact section. You can also say out your issues by filling in the form at the contact section, and we will get back to you within 24 hours.
