The WinnersOnlineHospital is a meant to connect patients to doctors or healcth care facilities without necessarily reaching the hospital in person.
Health is the backbone of every nation and so every country has to invest dearly in the health sector to see it's citizens in good life.
To access these online hospital services, you need to create an account by registering then login.

In this project, I used the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* PHP
* MySQL

To use the online hospital, you'll land on the home window which consist of various pages that will help you navigate to other parts of the system. But accessing our services will require
a patient to creat an account by clicking on the patient iccon on the top nav in the home page, chose sign up then register. After successfull registration, the form will take you
to a login page which after filling correctly, will lead you to the fashboard where you can fully access our services.
